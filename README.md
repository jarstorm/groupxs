## Node.js Bookstore example

#### Installation
Install local dependencies
```
npm install
```

#### Running unit test
Execute all unit tests (mocha will look for pattern based `test` named files)

##### Running once
```
npm test
```

##### Running mocha tests with file watchers
```
npm run test-dev
```


### Example of use
The example provided by email could be solved using:
```
calculate(8, [2, 2, 2, 1, 1], [0, 5, 10, 20, 25]);
```

Note that the result I get (I think it's the good one) is 51.60 instead of 51.20 provided in the email
